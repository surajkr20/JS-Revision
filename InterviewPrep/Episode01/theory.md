=>> personal introduction
"Good morning/afternoon, my name is Suraj Kumar. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA) from the College of Commerce, Arts, and Science, and I am set to graduate in 2025. My technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js, and I have hands-on experience with the MERN stack. I also have foundational knowledge in C++, Java, SQL, and MongoDB.

=>> projects explanation
During my academic journey, I worked on several projects, including an Uber Clone, which integrates features like secure authentication, real-time ride tracking, and payment functionality, and a Zoom Clone, which includes features like peer-to-peer (P2P) connections, real-time video/audio calls, and chat functionality. These projects provided me with practical experience in full-stack development and solving real-world problems.

Currently, I am working on more full-stack projects inspired by real-world challenges, using the MERN stack, and enhancing my DSA problem-solving skills in Java. My passion for learning and building innovative solutions drives me to continuously improve and stay updated with the latest technologies.

Beyond academics, I enjoy participating in coding challenges and exploring emerging tech trends. I am excited about this opportunity to showcase my skills and contribute to your team."

# 2. Specificity and Cascade Rule in css?

**Cascade Rule**:  
The cascade in CSS determines which styles are applied to an element when there are conflicting rules. It resolves conflicts based on importance (`!important`), origin of styles (browser, user, or author), specificity of the selectors, and the order of appearance in the stylesheet.

**Specificity**:  
Specificity is a scoring system in CSS that determines which rule takes precedence when multiple rules apply to the same element. It is calculated based on the type of selectors used:  
- Inline styles have the highest specificity.  
- ID selectors are stronger than classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes.  
- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes are stronger than type selectors and pseudo-elements.

If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears later in the stylesheet takes precedence.

# 3. BoxModel in css?

The CSS **Box Model** describes how elements are structured and spaced on a web page. It consists of four areas: **content**, **padding**, **border**, and **margin**.

### **1. Content**
The **content** area is where the actual text, images, or other content of the element is displayed. Its size can be controlled using properties like `width` and `height`.

### **2. Padding**
The **padding** is the space between the content and the element's border. It creates inner spacing around the content and can be controlled with properties like `padding`, `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left`.

### **3. Border**
The **border** surrounds the padding (or content if no padding is set). It’s the visible edge of the element and can be styled using properties like `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color`.

### **4. Margin**
The **margin** is the outermost layer, creating space between the element and neighboring elements. It controls the external spacing using properties like `margin`, `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left`.

### **Box-Sizing Property**:
By default, the size calculations only include the content (`box-sizing: content-box`). To include padding and border in the width/height calculations, use:
